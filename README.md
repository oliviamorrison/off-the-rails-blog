RAILSBRIDGE Group Project - OFF THE RAILS

Each group got approximately 4 hours to build a website using ruby on rails.
This was our first experience using Ruby on Rails!

We made a blog website with ruby on rails.
It has very basic functionality so you can make a post with a title and content. You can also delete posts and the post shows what time it was posted.
